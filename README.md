# Portfolio Website

This is a website that is dedicated to me! It is competely static using HTML, SCSS, CSS and JS (none of the fancy stuff like React, Vue or... Ang...ular... :open_mouth:)

## MVP

- [x] You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
- [x] In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
- [x] You are to use SCSS for styling.
- [x] You are to use B.E.M as a naming convention.
- [x] Responsiveness is vital â€“ use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good at all screen widths. VERY CRITICAL! You will need to make sure that your website looks good on phones, tablets and laptops.
- [x] A landing page/section with your name and title on it.
- [x] An About page/section with a little bit about you
- [x] A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course.
- [x] A Project page/section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo (using a README.md at the root of the repo to include how you went about coding for that project)
- [x] A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link
